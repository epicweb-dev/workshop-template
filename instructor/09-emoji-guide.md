## Character Guidelines

### 👨‍💼 Peter

**Kellie explains past work** (with `<PrevDiffLink />`):

<PrevDiffLink>You can check what I did here.</PrevDiffLink>
```

**Kellie explains upcoming work** (with `<NextDiffLink />`):
```mdx
🧝‍♀️ In the next step, I'll apply the same pattern to the remaining
form fields. If you'd like more practice, feel free to do it yourself
before moving on!
<NextDiffLink>Check the upcoming changes</NextDiffLink>
