# Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal:** Understand the topic, audience, and scope before designing exercises.

## Step 1.1: Understand the Topic

Ask the instructor these questions:

```
To create a great workshop, I need to understand:

1. What is the main topic? (e.g., "React Server Components", "Vitest Mocking")
2. Who is the target audience? (beginners, intermediate, advanced)
3. What should learners be able to do after completing the workshop?
4. How long should the workshop be? (2-4 hours, 4-8 hours, full day)
5. Are there specific technologies/frameworks required?
```

## Step 1.2: Research the Topic

Before designing exercises:

1. Review official documentation for the topic
2. Identify core concepts that must be covered
3. Find common pain points and misconceptions
4. Understand best practices and anti-patterns
5. Note any prerequisites learners need

## Step 1.3: Define Boundaries

Create a scope document:

```markdown
## In Scope
- [Core concept 1]
- [Core concept 2]
- [Core concept 3]

## Out of Scope
- [Related but not essential topic]
- [Advanced topic for future workshop]

## Prerequisites
- [What learners must already know]
```

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding, confirm with the instructor:

```
Based on my research, here's what I understand:

**Topic:** [Summary]
**Audience:** [Who this is for]
**Duration:** [Expected length]
**Core concepts:** [List]
**Prerequisites:** [List]

Does this match your vision? Should I proceed to planning?
```

## Next Step

Once approved, proceed to: `02-planning.md`
