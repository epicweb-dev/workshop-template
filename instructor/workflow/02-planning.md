# Phase 2: Planning

**Goal:** Design the exercise structure and flow before implementation.

**Reference:** For planning best practices, see `../02-workshop-planning.md`

## Prerequisites

Before starting this phase, ensure you have answers to all discovery questions from Phase 1, including:
- App type (simple files vs project apps)
- Testing approach (in-browser vs test scripts)
- Workshop series context (previous/follow-up workshops)
- Target audience and experience level
- Workshop duration

## Step 2.1: Draft Exercise List

Create a high-level exercise outline that incorporates discovery answers:

```markdown
# Workshop: [Title]

## Overview
- **Duration:** [From discovery]
- **App Type:** [Simple files / Project apps]
- **Testing:** [In-browser / Test scripts / Both]
- **Previous Workshop:** [Name or "Standalone"]
- **Follow-up Planned:** [Yes/No]

## Exercise Plan

### 01. [First Exercise Name]
- Core concept to teach
- Why this comes first

### 02. [Second Exercise Name]
- Concept this teaches
- How it builds on 01

### 03. [Third Exercise Name]
- Concept this teaches
- How it builds on previous
```

## Step 2.2: Design Each Exercise

For each exercise, define the steps:

```markdown
## Exercise: [Name]

**Learning Objective:** [One sentence]

**Concepts Covered:**
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]

**Steps:**
1. [step-name] - [What this teaches]
2. [step-name] - [What this adds]
3. [step-name] - [What this completes]

**Key Takeaway:** [Main insight]
```

## Step 2.3: Verify Flow

Check the exercise plan:

- [ ] Does difficulty progress smoothly?
- [ ] Does each exercise build on previous knowledge?
- [ ] Are there any gaps in coverage?
- [ ] Can each step be completed in 15-30 minutes?
- [ ] Is the total length appropriate for target duration?
- [ ] Does the app type match the complexity needed for each exercise?
- [ ] Is the testing approach consistent and appropriate?
- [ ] If continuation: Does it properly build on the previous workshop?
- [ ] If follow-up planned: Are boundaries clear on what's deferred?

## Workshop Length Guidelines

| Workshop Type | Exercises | Steps per Exercise | Total Duration |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Short | 4-6 | 2-4 | 2-4 hours |
| Standard | 6-10 | 3-5 | 4-8 hours |
| Comprehensive | 8-12 | 4-6 | 8-16 hours |

## Checkpoint

Present the plan to the instructor:

```
Here's my proposed workshop structure:

**Configuration:**
- App Type: [Simple files / Project apps]
- Testing: [In-browser / Test scripts / Both]
- Duration: [X hours/days]

**Workshop Series:**
- Previous: [Workshop name or "Standalone"]
- Follow-up: [Planned topic or "None"]

[Full exercise plan with steps]

**Scope boundaries:**
- In scope: [Key topics]
- Out of scope: [Excluded topics]
- Deferred to follow-up: [If applicable]

Questions:
1. Does this cover what you wanted?
2. Is the order logical?
3. Should anything be added or removed?
4. Is the difficulty progression appropriate?
5. Are the app type and testing approach correct for this content?
```

## Next Step

Once the plan is approved, proceed to: `03-setup.md`
