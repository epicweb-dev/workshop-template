# Phase 2: Planning

**Goal:** Design the exercise structure and flow before implementation.

**Reference:** For planning best practices, see `../02-workshop-planning.md`

## Step 2.1: Draft Exercise List

Create a high-level exercise outline:

```markdown
# Workshop: [Title]

## Exercise Plan

### 01. [First Exercise Name]
- Core concept to teach
- Why this comes first

### 02. [Second Exercise Name]
- Concept this teaches
- How it builds on 01

### 03. [Third Exercise Name]
- Concept this teaches
- How it builds on previous
```

## Step 2.2: Design Each Exercise

For each exercise, define the steps:

```markdown
## Exercise: [Name]

**Learning Objective:** [One sentence]

**Concepts Covered:**
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]

**Steps:**
1. [step-name] - [What this teaches]
2. [step-name] - [What this adds]
3. [step-name] - [What this completes]

**Key Takeaway:** [Main insight]
```

## Step 2.3: Verify Flow

Check the exercise plan:

- [ ] Does difficulty progress smoothly?
- [ ] Does each exercise build on previous knowledge?
- [ ] Are there any gaps in coverage?
- [ ] Can each step be completed in 15-30 minutes?
- [ ] Is the total length appropriate for target duration?

## Workshop Length Guidelines

| Workshop Type | Exercises | Steps per Exercise | Total Duration |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Short | 4-6 | 2-4 | 2-4 hours |
| Standard | 6-10 | 3-5 | 4-8 hours |
| Comprehensive | 8-12 | 4-6 | 8-16 hours |

## Checkpoint

Present the plan to the instructor:

```
Here's my proposed workshop structure:

[Full exercise plan with steps]

Questions:
1. Does this cover what you wanted?
2. Is the order logical?
3. Should anything be added or removed?
4. Is the difficulty progression appropriate?
```

## Next Step

Once the plan is approved, proceed to: `03-setup.md`
