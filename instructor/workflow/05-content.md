# Phase 5: Content

**Goal:** Write the README.mdx files for all exercises and steps.

**Reference:** For MDX formatting and components, see `../05-mdx-and-content.md`
**Reference:** For emoji character usage, see `../09-emoji-guide.md`

## Emoji Characters for Content

| Emoji | Character | Use for |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 👨‍💼 | Peter | Context, requirements, celebrating completion |
| 🐨 | Kody | Specific instructions |
| 🧝‍♀️ | Kellie | Explaining work done or upcoming (with diff links) |
| 🦺 | Lily | TypeScript guidance |
| 💰 | Marty | Tips and hints |
| 📜 | Dominic | Documentation links |
| 📝 | Nancy | Note-taking prompts |
| 🦉 | Olivia | Best practices |

### Using Kellie with Diff Links

Kellie (🧝‍♀️) explains work that was done between steps or will be done next:

**Explaining past work** (learner hasn't seen it):
```mdx
🧝‍♀️ I've already set up the database connection and created the schema.
<PrevDiffLink>Check what I did</PrevDiffLink>
```

**Explaining upcoming work** (repetitive/optional practice):
```mdx
🧝‍♀️ In the next step, I'll apply validation to the remaining fields.
If you'd like more practice, try doing it yourself first!
<NextDiffLink>See the upcoming changes</NextDiffLink>
```

Use Kellie when:
- Setup work was done that learners didn't see
- Repetitive work is coming that learners can skip or try themselves
- Boilerplate needs explanation but isn't the learning focus
